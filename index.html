        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example games, responses when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling and animation). This brief documentation helps you get started with this exciting language and gives you an idea of what is possible.</p>

          <h2>What you should already know</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>Some programming experience.</li>

          <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus etc.) There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allows you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as real-time collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <strong><em>Array</em></strong>, <strong><em>Date</em></strong>, <strong><em>Math</em></strong> and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and it's Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input and page navigation.</li>
          <li><em>Server-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing Numeric, Boolean and String values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private or protected and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
        <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>

          <pre>
            <code>

        <header>
          <h2>Variables</h2>
        </header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called <em><u>identifiers</u></em>, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>Some examples of legal names are "Number_hits", "temp99", "$credit" and "_name".</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>
          <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
        </header>
        <p>You can declare variable in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin: 1.5rem 0 2.5rem 0;">
            With the keyword <strong>var</strong>. For example:
            <figure style="padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
              <code style="color: #000;">
                var x = 42
              </code>
            </figure>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </li>
          <li style="margin: 0 0 2.5rem 0;">
            By simply assigning it a value. For example:
            <figure style="padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
              <code style="color: #000;">
                x  = 42
              </code>
            </figure>
            If this form is used outside of function, it declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the keyword <strong>let</strong>. For example:
            <figure style="padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
              <code style="color: #000;">
                let y = 13
              </code>
            </figure>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. See "Variable scope" in detail below.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>
          <h2>Variable scope</h2>
        </header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <em>global</em> variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a <em>local</em> variable, because it is available only within that function</p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the <em>function (or global scope)</em> that the block resides within. For example the following code will log <strong>5</strong>, because the scope of <strong>x</strong> is the function (or global context) within which <strong>x</strong> is declared, not the block, which in this case is an <strong>if</strong> statement.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (true) {
                var x = 5;
              }
              console.log(x); //It will print '5'
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>This behaviour changes, when using the <strong>let</strong> declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (true) {
                let y = 5;
              }
              console.log(y);
              //It will show 'ReferenceError: y is not defined'
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>
          <h2>Global variables</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the <em>global object</em>. In web pages, the global object is <strong>window</strong>, so you can set and access global variables using the <strong><em>window.variable</em></strong> syntax.</p>
        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called <strong>phoneNumber</strong> is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as <strong>parent.phoneNumber</strong>.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>
          <h2>Constants</h2>
        </header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the <strong><em>const</em></strong> keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign ($) and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
        <figure style="padding: 1rem 0 1rem 8rem;">
          <code style="color: #000;">
              const PI = 3.14;
          </code>
        </figure>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initalized to a value.</p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for <strong>let</strong> block-scope variables. If the <strong>const</strong> keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              //THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
              function f() {};
              const f = 5;

              //THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO
              function f() {
                const g = 5;
                var g;

                //statements
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};
              MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue';
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML', 'CSS'];
              MY_ARRAY.push('JAVASCRIPT');
              console.log(MY_ARRAY);
              //logs ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JAVASCRIPT']
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>
          <h2>Data types</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are <em><u>primitives</u></em>:</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: none;">
          <ul>
            <li><em><u>Boolean</u></em> <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>.</li>
            <li><em><u>null</u></em> A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, <strong>null</strong> is not the same as <strong>Null</strong>, <strong>NULL</strong>, or any other variant.</li>
            <li><em><u>undefined</u></em> A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
            <li><em><u>Number</u></em> An integer or floating point number. For example: <b>42</b> or <b>3.14159</b></li>
            <li><em><u>String</u></em> A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: <b>"Howdy"</b></li>
            <li><em><u>Symbol</u></em> (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and <em><u>Object</u></em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>
          <h2>if...else statement</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Use the <strong>if</strong> statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional <strong>else</strong> clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An <strong>if</strong> statement looks as follows:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (condition) {
                statement_1;
              } else {
                statement_2;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>Here the <strong>condition</strong> can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. If <strong>condition</strong> evaluates to true, <i><b>statement_1</b></i> is executed; otherwise, <i><b>statement_2</b></i> is executed. <i>statement_1</i> and <i>statement_2</i> can be any statement, including further nested <strong>if</strong> statements.</p>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using <strong>else if</strong> to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (condition_1){
                statement_1;
              } else if (condition_2) {
                statement_2;
              } else if (condition_n) {
                statement_n;
              } else {
                statement_last;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement <strong>({ ... })</strong>. In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting <strong>if</strong> statements:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (condition) {
                statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (x = y) {
                /* statements here */
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if ((x = y)) {
                /* statements here */
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>
          <h2>while statement</h2>
        </header>
        <p>A <strong>while</strong> statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A <strong>while</strong> statement looks as follows:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              while (condition)
                statement
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>If the condition becomes false, <b>statement</b> within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
        <p>The condition test occurs before <b>statement</b> in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, <b>statement</b> is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following <strong>while</strong>.</p>
        <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement <strong>({ ... })</strong> to group those statements.</p>
        <p>The following <strong>while</strong> loop iterates as long as <b>n</b> is less than three:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              var n = 0;
              var x = 0;
              while (n &lt; 3) {
                n++;
                x += n;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>With each iteration, the loop increments <b>n</b> and adds that value to <b>x</b>. Therefore, <b>x</b> and <b>n</b> take on the following values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: <b><i>n</i> = 1</b> and <b><i>x</i> = 1</b></li>
          <li>After the second pass: <b><i>n</i> = 2</b> and <b><i>x</i> = 3</b></li>
          <li>After the third pass: <b><i>n</i> = 3</b> and <b><i>x</i> = 6</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 3rem 0;">After completing the third pass, the condition <b>n &lt; 3</b> is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
        <p>Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loopp eventually becomes false; otherwise, the loop will never terminate. The statements in the following <strong>while</strong> loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              while (true) {

        <p>A <strong>function definition</strong> (also called a <strong>function declaration</strong>, or <strong>function statement</strong>) consists of the <i><u>function</u></i> keyword, followed by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
          <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, <b>{}</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named <b>square</b>:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              function square(number) {
                return number * number;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>The function <b>square</b> takes one parameter, called <b>number</b>. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, <i>number</i>) multiplied by itself. The statement <b>return</b> specifies the value returned by the function:</p>
        <figure style="padding: 1rem 0 1rem 7rem;">
          <code style="color: #000;">
            return number * number;
          </code>
        </figure>
        <p>Primitive paramaters (such as a number) are passed to functions <strong>by value</strong>; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, <strong>this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as <strong>Array</strong> or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              function myFunc(theObject) {
                theObject.make = 'Toyota';
              }

              var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};
              var x, y;

              x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"

              myFunc(mycar);
              y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
                              // (the make property was changed by the function)
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>

          <h2>Function scope</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined. In other words, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in its parent function and any other variable to which the parent function has access.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <code>
              // The following variables are defined in the global scope:
              var num1 = 20,
                  num2 = 3,
                  name = 'Charles';

              // This function is defined in the global scope
              function multiply() {
                return num1 * num2;
              }

              multiply(); // Returns 60

              // A nested function example
              function getScore() {
                var num1 = 2,
                    num2 = 3;

                function add() {
                  return name + ' scored ' + (num1 + num2);
                }

                return add();
              }

              getScore(); // Returns "Charles scored 5"
